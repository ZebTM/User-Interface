## To Do List
- Need to get the ability to enter in a review of a book
    - For this I need to generate some fake data for books in the "system"
    - I think we, for right now, should prioritize reviews on books as a whole and think about bringing in parts of the book later.
        - This can be a future goal
- Build out the home page
    - Gives a list of current books you have/are/plan to read and the reviews of the previous
        - Currently I am using a svelte-splide to display the carousel on the home page for
            - Planned readings
            - Currently reading
            - Finished reading
